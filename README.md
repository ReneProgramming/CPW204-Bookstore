This repository is a class example used to gain 
experience with source control and TypeScript. 

## Getting Started 

### Installing TypeScript
- Download and Install the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- In the command line run `npm install -g typescript`.    
Note: "typescript" needs to be all lowercase

### Compiling TypeScript
To compile the Typescript files, with the watch option,  
run the following command: `tsc --watch`.  Using the 
watch option, only requires us to compile once each 
time the project is opened.
